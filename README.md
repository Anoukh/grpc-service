## What you’ll build 
To understanding how you can build a RESTful web service using Ballerina, let’s consider a real world use case of an order management scenario of an online retail application. 
We can model the order management scenario as a RESTful web service; 'OrderMgtService',  which accepts different HTTP request for order management tasks such as order creation, retrieval, updating and deletion.
The following figure illustrates all the required functionalities of the OrderMgt RESTful web service that we need to build. 

![RESTful Service](images/gRPC-service.png "gPRC Service")

- **Create Order** : To place a new order you can use the HTTP POST message that contains the order details, which is sent to the URL `http://xyz.retail.com/order`.The response from the service contains an HTTP 201 Created message with the location header pointing to the newly created resource `http://xyz.retail.com/order/123456`. 
- **Retrieve Order** : You can retrieve the order details by sending an HTTP GET request to the appropriate URL which includes the order ID.`http://xyz.retail.com/order/<orderId>` 
- **Update Order** : You can update an existing order by sending a HTTP PUT request with the content for the updated order. 
- **Delete Order** : An existing order can be deleted by sending a HTTP DELETE request to the specific URL`http://xyz.retail.com/order/<orderId>`. 

## Prerequisites
 
- JDK 1.8 or later
- [Ballerina Distribution](https://github.com/ballerina-lang/ballerina/blob/master/docs/quick-tour.md)
- A Text Editor or an IDE 

### Optional requirements
- Ballerina IDE plugins ([IntelliJ IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9520-ballerina), [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WSO2.Ballerina), [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/language-ballerina))
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

## Developing the service 

> If you want to skip the basics, you can download the git repo and directly move to "Testing" section by skipping "Developing" section.

### Create the project structure

Ballerina is a complete programming language that can have any custom project structure that you wish. Although the language allows you to have any package structure, use the following package structure for this project to follow this guide.

```
grpc-service
  ├── guide.grpc_service
  │   └── order_mgt_service.bal
  └── guide.grpc_client
      ├── order_mgt.pb.bal
      └── order_mgt.sample.client.bal
```
You can create the above Ballerina project using Ballerina project initializing toolkit.

- First, create a new directory in your local machine as `restful-service` and navigate to the directory using terminal. 
- Then enter the following inputs to the Ballerina project initializing toolkit.
```bash
restful-service$ ballerina init -i
Create Ballerina.toml [yes/y, no/n]: (y) y
Organization name: (username) restful-service
Version: (0.0.1) 
Ballerina source [service/s, main/m]: (s) s
Package for the service : (no package) guide.restful_service
Ballerina source [service/s, main/m, finish/f]: (f) f

Ballerina project initialized
```

- Once you initialize your Ballerina project, you can change the names of the file to match with our guide project file names.
  
### Implement the gRPC service

- We can get started with a Ballerina service; 'OrderMgtService', which is the RESTful service that serves the order management request. OrderMgtService can have multiple resources and each resource is dedicated for a specific order management functionality.

- You can add the content to your Ballerina service as shown below. In that code segment you can find the implementation of the service and resource skeletons of 'OrderMgtService'. 
For each order management operation, there is a dedicated resource and inside each resource we can implement the order management operation logic. 

##### order_mgt_service.bal
```ballerina
import ballerina/grpc;

// gRPC service endpoint definition
endpoint grpc:Listener listener {
    host:"localhost",
    port:9090
};

// Order management is done using an in memory map.
// Add some sample orders to 'orderMap' at startup.
map<newOrder> ordersMap;

// Type definition for an order
type newOrder {
    string id;
    string name;
    string description;
};

@Description {value:"gRPC service."}
@grpc:serviceConfig
service order_mgt bind listener {

    @Description {value:"gRPC method to find an order"}
    findOrder(endpoint caller, string orderId) {
        string payload;
        // Find the requested order from the map.
        if (ordersMap.hasKey(orderId)) {
            json orderDetails = check <json>ordersMap[orderId];
            payload = orderDetails.toString();
        } else {
            payload = "Order : '" + orderId + "' cannot be found.";
        }

        // Send response to the caller.
        _ = caller->send(payload);
        _ = caller->complete();
    }

    @Description {value:"gRPC method to create a new Order."}
    addOrder(endpoint caller, newOrder orderReq) {
        // Add the new order to the map.
        string orderId = orderReq.id;
        ordersMap[orderReq.id] = orderReq;
        // Create response message.
        string payload = "Status : Order created; OrderID : " + orderId;

        // Send response to the caller.
        _ = caller->send(payload);
        _ = caller->complete();
    }

    @Description {value:"gRPC method to update an existing Order."}
    updateOrder(endpoint caller, newOrder updatedOrder) {
        string payload;
        // Find the order that needs to be updated.
        string orderId = updatedOrder.id;
        if (ordersMap.hasKey(orderId)) {
            // Update the existing order.
            ordersMap[orderId] = updatedOrder;
            payload = "Order : '" + orderId + "' updated.";
        } else {
            payload = "Order : '" + orderId + "' cannot be found.";
        }

        // Send response to the caller.
        _ = caller->send(payload);
        _ = caller->complete();
    }

    @Description {value:"gRPC method to delete an existing Order."}
    cancelOrder(endpoint caller, string orderId) {
        string payload;
        if (ordersMap.hasKey(orderId)) {
            // Remove the requested order from the map.
            _ = ordersMap.remove(orderId);
            payload = "Order : '" + orderId + "' removed.";
        } else {
            payload = "Order : '" + orderId + "' cannot be found.";
        }

        // Send response to the caller.
        _ = caller->send(payload);
        _ = caller->complete();
    }
}
```

- You can implement the business logic of each resources as per your requirements. For simplicity we have used an in-memory map to keep all the order details. You can find the full source code of the OrderMgtService below. In addition to the order processing logic, we have also manipulated some HTTP status codes and headers whenever required.  


##### order_mgt.sample.client.bal
```ballerina

import ballerina/log;
import ballerina/grpc;

// This is client implementation for unary blocking scenario
function main(string... args) {
    // Client endpoint configuration
    endpoint order_mgtBlockingClient order_mgtBlockingEp {
        url:"http://localhost:9090"
    };

    // Create an order
    log:printInfo("---------------------------Create a new order---------------------------");
    newOrder orderReq = {id:"100500", name:"XYZ", description:"Sample order."};
    var addResponse = order_mgtBlockingEp->addOrder(orderReq);
    match addResponse {
        (string, grpc:Headers) payload => {
            string result;
            grpc:Headers resHeaders;
            (result, resHeaders) = payload;
            log:printInfo("Response - " + result + "\n");
        }
        error err => {
            log:printError("Error from Connector: " + err.message + "\n");
        }
    }

    // Update an order
    log:printInfo("------------------------Update an existing order------------------------");
    newOrder updateReq = {id:"100500", name:"XYZ", description:"Updated order."};
    var updateResponse = order_mgtBlockingEp->updateOrder(updateReq);
    match updateResponse {
        (string, grpc:Headers) payload => {
            string result;
            grpc:Headers resHeaders;
            (result, resHeaders) = payload;
            log:printInfo("Response - " + result + "\n");
        }
        error err => {
            log:printError("Error from Connector: " + err.message + "\n");
        }
    }

    // Find an order
    log:printInfo("-------------------------Find an existing order-------------------------");
    var findResponse = order_mgtBlockingEp->findOrder("100500");
    match findResponse {
        (string, grpc:Headers) payload => {
            string result;
            grpc:Headers resHeaders;
            (result, resHeaders) = payload;
            log:printInfo("Response - " + result + "\n");
        }
        error err => {
            log:printError("Error from Connector: " + err.message + "\n");
        }
    }

    // Cancel an order
    log:printInfo("-----------------------------Cancel an order----------------------------");
    var cancelResponse = order_mgtBlockingEp->cancelOrder("100500");
    match cancelResponse {
        (string, grpc:Headers) payload => {
            string result;
            grpc:Headers resHeaders;
            (result, resHeaders) = payload;
            log:printInfo("Response - " + result + "\n");
        }
        error err => {
            log:printError("Error from Connector: " + err.message + "\n");
        }
    }
}
```

- With that we've completed the development of OrderMgtService. 


## Testing 

### Invoking the RESTful service 

You can run the RESTful service that you developed above, in your local environment. Open your terminal and navigate to `<SAMPLE_ROOT_DIRECTORY>/guide.restful_service` and execute the following command.
```
$ballerina run restful_service
```
NOTE: You need to have the Ballerina installed in you local machine to run the Ballerina service.  

You can test the functionality of the OrderMgt RESTFul service by sending HTTP request for each order management operation. For example, we have used the curl commands to test each operation of OrderMgtService as follows. 

**Create Order** 
```
curl -v -X POST -d \
'{ "Order": { "ID": "100500", "Name": "XYZ", "Description": "Sample order."}}' \
"http://localhost:9090/ordermgt/order" -H "Content-Type:application/json"

Output :  
< HTTP/1.1 201 Created
< Content-Type: application/json
< Location: http://localhost:9090/ordermgt/order/100500
< Transfer-Encoding: chunked
< Server: wso2-http-transport

{"status":"Order Created.","orderId":"100500"} 
```

**Retrieve Order** 
```
curl "http://localhost:9090/ordermgt/order/100500" 

Output : 
{"Order":{"ID":"100500","Name":"XYZ","Description":"Sample order."}}
```

**Update Order** 
```
curl -X PUT -d '{ "Order": {"Name": "XYZ", "Description": "Updated order."}}' \
"http://localhost:9090/ordermgt/order/100500" -H "Content-Type:application/json"

Output: 
{"Order":{"ID":"100500","Name":"XYZ","Description":"Updated order."}}
```

**Cancel Order** 
```
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:9090/ordermgt/order/100500"

Output:
"Order : 100500 removed."
```

### Writing unit tests 

In Ballerina, the unit test cases should be in the same package inside a folder named as 'test'. The naming convention should be as follows,

* Test functions should contain test prefix.
  * e.g.: testResourceAddOrder()

This guide contains unit test cases for each resource available in the 'order_mgt_service.bal'.

To run the unit tests, go to the sample `guide.restful_service` directory and run the following command.
```bash
   $ballerina test
```

To check the implementation of the test file, refer to the [order_mgt_service_test.bal](https://github.com/ballerina-guides/restful-service/blob/master/guide.restful_service/restful_service/test/order_mgt_service_test.bal).


## Deployment

Once you are done with the development, you can deploy the service using any of the methods that we listed below. 

### Deploying locally

- As the first step you can build a Ballerina executable archive (.balx) of the service that we developed above, using the following command. It points to the directory in which the service we developed above located and it will create an executable binary out of that. Navigate to the `<SAMPLE_ROOT>/guide.restful_service/` folder and run the following command. 

```
$ballerina build restful_service
```

- Once the restful_service.balx is created inside the target folder, you can run that with the following command. 

```
$ballerina run target/restful_service.balx
```

- The successful execution of the service should show us the following output. 
```
$ ballerina run target/restful_service.balx 

ballerina: deploying service(s) in 'target/restful_service.balx'
ballerina: started HTTP/WS server connector 0.0.0.0:9090
```
### Deploying on Docker


You can run the service that we developed above as a docker container. As Ballerina platform offers native support for running ballerina programs on 
containers, you just need to put the corresponding docker annotations on your service code. 

- In our OrderMgtService, we need to import  `` import ballerinax/docker; `` and use the annotation `` @docker:Config `` as shown below to enable docker image generation during the build time. 

##### order_mgt_service.bal
```ballerina
package restful_service;

import ballerina/http;
import ballerinax/docker;

@docker:Config {
    registry:"ballerina.guides.io",
    name:"restful_service",
    tag:"v1.0"
}

@docker:Expose{}
endpoint http:Listener listener {
    port:9090
};

// Order management is done using an in memory map.
// Add some sample orders to 'orderMap' at startup.
map<json> ordersMap;

@Description {value:"RESTful service."}
@http:ServiceConfig {basePath:"/ordermgt"}
service<http:Service> order_mgt bind listener {
``` 

- Now you can build a Ballerina executable archive (.balx) of the service that we developed above, using the following command. It points to the service file that we developed above and it will create an executable binary out of that. 
This will also create the corresponding docker image using the docker annotations that you have configured above. Navigate to the `<SAMPLE_ROOT>/guide.restful_service/` folder and run the following command.  
  
```
   $ballerina build restful_service

   Run following command to start docker container: 
   docker run -d -p 9090:9090 ballerina.guides.io/restful_service:v1.0
```

- Once you successfully build the docker image, you can run it with the `` docker run`` command that is shown in the previous step.  

```   
   docker run -d -p 9090:9090 ballerina.guides.io/restful_service:v1.0
```

  Here we run the docker image with flag`` -p <host_port>:<container_port>`` so that we  use  the host port 9090 and the container port 9090. Therefore you can access the service through the host port. 

- Verify docker container is running with the use of `` $ docker ps``. The status of the docker container should be shown as 'Up'. 
- You can access the service using the same curl commands that we've used above. 
 
```
   curl -v -X POST -d '{ "Order": { "ID": "100500", "Name": "XYZ", "Description": "Sample \
   order."}}' "http://localhost:9090/ordermgt/order" -H "Content-Type:application/json"    
```

### Deploying on Kubernetes

- You can run the service that we developed above, on Kubernetes. The Ballerina language offers native support for running a ballerina programs on Kubernetes, 
with the use of Kubernetes annotations that you can include as part of your service code. Also, it will take care of the creation of the docker images. 
So you don't need to explicitly create docker images prior to deploying it on Kubernetes.   

- We need to import `` import ballerinax/kubernetes; `` and use `` @kubernetes `` annotations as shown below to enable kubernetes deployment for the service we developed above. 

##### order_mgt_service.bal

```ballerina
package restful_service;

import ballerina/http;
import ballerinax/kubernetes;

@kubernetes:Ingress {
    hostname:"ballerina.guides.io",
    name:"ballerina-guides-restful-service",
    path:"/"
}

@kubernetes:Service {
    serviceType:"NodePort",
    name:"ballerina-guides-restful-service"
}

@kubernetes:Deployment {
    image:"ballerina.guides.io/restful_service:v1.0",
    name:"ballerina-guides-restful-service"
}

endpoint http:Listener listener {
    port:9090
};

// Order management is done using an in memory map.
// Add some sample orders to 'orderMap' at startup.
map<json> ordersMap;

@Description {value:"RESTful service."}
@http:ServiceConfig {basePath:"/ordermgt"}
service<http:Service> order_mgt bind listener {    
``` 

- Here we have used ``  @kubernetes:Deployment `` to specify the docker image name which will be created as part of building this service. 
- We have also specified `` @kubernetes:Service {} `` so that it will create a Kubernetes service which will expose the Ballerina service that is running on a Pod.  
- In addition we have used `` @kubernetes:Ingress `` which is the external interface to access your service (with path `` /`` and host name ``ballerina.guides.io``)

- Now you can build a Ballerina executable archive (.balx) of the service that we developed above, using the following command. It points to the service file that we developed above and it will create an executable binary out of that. 
This will also create the corresponding docker image and the Kubernetes artifacts using the Kubernetes annotations that you have configured above.
  
```
   $ballerina build restful_service
  
   Run following command to deploy kubernetes artifacts:  
   kubectl apply -f ./target/restful_service/kubernetes
```

- You can verify that the docker image that we specified in `` @kubernetes:Deployment `` is created, by using `` docker images ``. 
- Also the Kubernetes artifacts related our service, will be generated in `` ./target/restful_service/kubernetes``. 
- Now you can create the Kubernetes deployment using:

```
   $ kubectl apply -f ./target/restful_service/kubernetes 
 
   deployment.extensions "ballerina-guides-restful-service" created
   ingress.extensions "ballerina-guides-restful-service" created
   service "ballerina-guides-restful-service" created
```

- You can verify Kubernetes deployment, service and ingress are running properly, by using following Kubernetes commands.

```
   $kubectl get service
   $kubectl get deploy
   $kubectl get pods
   $kubectl get ingress
```

- If everything is successfully deployed, you can invoke the service either via Node port or ingress. 

Node Port:
 
```
curl -v -X POST -d \
'{ "Order": { "ID": "100500", "Name": "XYZ", "Description": "Sample order."}}' \
"http://localhost:<Node_Port>/ordermgt/order" -H "Content-Type:application/json"  
```

Ingress:

Add `/etc/hosts` entry to match hostname. 
``` 
127.0.0.1 ballerina.guides.io
```

Access the service 

``` 
curl -v -X POST -d \
'{ "Order": { "ID": "100500", "Name": "XYZ", "Description": "Sample order."}}' \
"http://ballerina.guides.io/ordermgt/order" -H "Content-Type:application/json" 
```
